# CSE-205-Projects
What has been created throughout the class CSE-205

The Home that has been done so far is not yet in the repository, but I have uploaded the code for our first project. 

Project1 (Main copy2.java)is reads integers from a txt file and places them in an ArrayList. That list is then searched for monotonically 
increasing/decreasing increments. Each run of count k is then placed in a new ArrayList. FInally the total amount of up/down 
runs are added and displayed into a new txt file.
