#CSE-205 Projects

This contains the Java programs I have created throughout my courses. 

Copy/paste the code into your favorite IDE and run/compile them to see the results. I will upload the relevant txt files for each in the near future. 

The most recent upload contains a game called "Pick a Number". Using Java, I created an ArrayList of 10 Integers between 0 and 20. Then, using the GUI interface, there is a promt for the user to enter a number from 0 to 20. The user enters a number and presses enter, then there is a pop-up that indicates whether or not the number entered is one of the 10 listed in the arraylist. The program uses recursion to complete a binary search through the arraylist, and uses mutiple GUI methods to make it more visually appealing.
